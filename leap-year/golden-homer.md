```js
const  isLeapYear(year) {
  return (year % 100 !== 0 && year % 4 === 0) || year % 400 === 0;
}


```

## Strategy

Golden Homer trying to check if a year is divisible by 4 and a year is not divisible by 100.
 Or the year is  divisible by 4 and divisible by 100.

## Implementation

 The code begins with an if statement to check a specific condition.

The % (modulus) operator is used to check the remainder of the division
   operation.

## Possible Refactors

- with `if` `else if`  statement
